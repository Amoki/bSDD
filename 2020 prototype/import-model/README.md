In case you would like to have your classifications and properties in the bSDD database, the best is to deliver them in the [bSDD import-model JSON](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/tree/master/2020%20prototype/import-model/bsdd-import-model.json) format.

We also have an Access database with which you can deliver data. This access database is a simplified version of the JSON model. If you want to use some of the more 'advanced' features, you should use the JSON model.

If you would like to deliver the data in a custom format, please contact us at bsdd_support@buildingsmart.org.

**IMPORTANT**: the bSDD API is currently under development. This means things may change. Check this Github site regularly! If you have any question regarding this subject send a mail to bsdd_support@buildingsmart.org.
